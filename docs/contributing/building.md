You'll need a working `go` environment version >= 1.11 (official releases are built against `1.13`).
It's also expected that you have a Docker daemon for building images.

Clone the repository. The project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules),
so if you explicitly define `$GOPATH` you should clone somewhere else.

Then, from the root directory:

```sh
make
```

This makes Docker images, and installs binaries to `$GOBIN` (if you define it) or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`.

> âš  Note:
> The default target architecture is amd64. If you would like
> to try to build Docker images and binaries for a different
> architecture you will have to set ARCH variable:
>
> ```sh
> make ARCH=<target_arch>
> ```

## Running tests

```sh
# Unit tests
make test

# End-to-end tests
make e2e
```
